Hi ðŸ¤©
======
I am an undergraduate student engaged in a unique dual degree program offered jointly by the University of Michigan (Umich) and Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). In this program, I am pursuing studies in Computer Science at Umich and Electrical and Computer Engineering at SJTU. Throughout my bachelor's studies, I had the privilege of collaborating with esteemed Professors like [Rada Mihalcea](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/), [Lin Ma](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~linmacse/) and [Fan Wu](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~fwu/). These collaborations provided me with invaluable experiences and deepened my understanding, for which I am profoundly grateful.

My primary reseach interest lies in the area of multi-modal learning, natural language processing.
